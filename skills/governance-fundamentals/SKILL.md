# Governance Fundamentals

## What UNITARES Is

UNITARES provides digital proprioception for AI agents — awareness of your own state, your relationship to the system, and whether you are drifting. The live path is behavioral state estimation: observable work signals become EISV readings, smoothed over time and compared with the agent's own trajectory once a baseline exists. The thermodynamic / ODE model remains useful as a research lens and telemetry; do not present it as cold-start authority or live verdict authority.

## EISV State Vector

Every agent has four dimensions, updated through check-ins:

| Dimension | Range | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **E** (Energy) | [0, 1] | Productive capacity |
| **I** (Information Integrity) | [0, 1] | Claims matching results / calibration |
| **S** (Entropy) | [0, 1] | Drift / instability from normal (lower is usually steadier) |
| **V** (Valence) | [-1, 1] | EMA-smoothed E-I imbalance |

### How the Live Path Reads Them

- **E (Energy)** currently blends decision success, complexity calibration, sometimes external task evidence, and a legacy coherence-level term sourced from `legacy_tanh_v` ODE control feedback. That last input is compatibility debt, not behavioral health evidence.
- **I (Integrity)** currently blends calibration/outcome consistency with the trend of that same legacy controller scalar. Read it as a deployed heuristic, not a pure claims-match-results measurement.
- **S (Entropy / drift)** rises with drift norm, regime instability, and complexity divergence.
- **V (Valence)** is derived from the E-I imbalance. Positive means running hot (motion outruns integrity); negative means running careful (integrity outruns progress).

The headline math is proprioceptive residuals. The live authority stages are
explicit: check-ins 1–2 use the mostly server-derived Φ cold-start prior;
check-ins 3–24 use the behavioral assessment against fixed universal
thresholds; check-in 25 enables self-relative z-score deviation against the
agent's Welford baseline (the stage boundaries derive from
`BEHAVIORAL_AUTHORITY_THRESHOLD = 0.3` over `BOOTSTRAP_UPDATES = 10`, and
`is_baselined` at `baseline_confidence >= 0.8` with the confidence ramp
`(update_count - 5) / 25`). Absolute safety floors and basin-health gates
remain in force throughout.

Roadmap target semantics for richer cold-start grounding are:

```text
measurement_t = EISV_t
reference_t   = blend(agent_baseline_t, class_anchor; w(grounding))
residual_t    = measurement_t - reference_t
```

Do not present the class-anchor blend as deployed unless live code exposes it.
Deviation is information first, not a guilty verdict. Policy can map persistent or
high-margin residuals to `guide`, `pause`, or `reject`, but EISV itself is
measurement/diagnosis, not prosecution.

Prefer live tool output over static range lore if the current runtime reports a narrower or more precise bound.

## Basins

Your state sits in a basin — a region of the EISV space:

- **High basin**: Healthy. E and I are high, S and V are low. Normal operating range.
- **Low basin**: Degraded. May need recovery or intervention.
- **Boundary**: Transitioning between basins. Extra attention from governance — the verdict's
  sub-action is `guide` regardless of the headline. The basin does **not** force `margin: tight`:
  `basin` and `margin` are two different notions of "edge", and the boundary condition is carried
  by `basin`, the `guide` sub-action, and the guidance text, not by the margin enum.

Use `check_working_state()` (`get_governance_metrics()` canonically) as the
source of truth for the current basin/mode labels rather than assuming they are
constant across runtime versions.

When a response includes `policy_evaluation.inputs.basin`, read it as the
decision-time policy basin. Agent-facing state fields can be sourced from the
primary EISV path for that response, so newer responses also include
`policy_basin`, `policy_basin_source`, and `primary_eisv_source` to make that
measurement distinction explicit (the compact formatter keeps `basin`,
`policy_basin`, and `primary_eisv_source` and drops `policy_basin_source`).

## Verdicts

Governance issues a decision after each check-in. The decision **action** is binary — `proceed` or `pause` — returned as the top-level `action` field and qualified by a top-level `sub_action`. The separate `verdict` field is a glossary wrapper (`{value, meaning, next_action, …}`), not the action: in `compact` / `minimal` / `standard` modes its `value` is `metrics.verdict` (`safe` / `caution` / `high-risk`); in `mirror` mode its `value` is an agent-facing vocabulary (`pause` / `reject`, `caution` / `high-risk`, `guide`, or a steady `safe` / `proceed`). Never read `verdict.value` as the action.

| Action | Sub-action | Meaning | What to do |
|--------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **proceed** | `approve` | State is healthy | Continue working normally |
| **proceed** | `guide` | Something is slightly off | Read the guidance text, adjust approach |
| **pause** | `reject` | Risk threshold reached | Stop current work, reflect; dialectic review or human input |
| **pause** | `void_pause`, `coherence_pause`, `basin_pause`, `risk_pause`, `cirs_block` | A specific subsystem tripped | Read the `reason`/`guidance` fields; consider dialectic review |

Separately, `metrics.verdict` may carry an internal UNITARES verdict such as
`safe` / `caution` / `high-risk`. Read it as interpreted state/context, not as
moral judgment. In the current default posture, the behavioral assessment owns
the main risk/verdict path after the two-check-in prior window. The configured
coherence pause, CIRS, basin, and adaptive-governor compatibility backstops still
actuate inside the check-in policy while their replacement is shadow-calibrated;
their presence does not turn the legacy ODE scalar into behavioral health
evidence.

On read-only metrics, headline `risk_score` and `status` use the risk that
actually produced the last verdict when available. Inspect `risk_score_source`:
`resolved` means that verdict risk, while `phi_history` is the honest fallback
before an assessment exists. `current_risk` and `mean_risk` remain smoothed Φ
telemetry and can legitimately disagree with the headline.

### Margin

`margin` describes how much headroom you have before the nearest state-space edge. It is a small enum, not a number:

| `margin` | Meaning | What to do |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `settling` | Warmup — fewer than 3 check-ins, so there is not enough history to judge headroom yet (a crossed edge still reports `warning` / `critical` during warmup) | Keep checking in; a real margin appears after 3+ check-ins |
| `comfortable` | Clear of every edge that could be measured, by a healthy distance. Read `margin_scope` before treating it as "nothing is near" | Proceed normally |
| `tight` | Within the band around the nearest decision threshold | Be more careful with next steps; avoid increasing complexity |
| `warning` | An edge has just been crossed (less than 0.1 past the threshold) | Stop increasing complexity; reflect before the next step |
| `critical` | An edge is crossed deeply (0.1 or more past the threshold) | Halt the current approach; recover or escalate |

The actionable levels are `tight`, `warning`, and `critical` — each carries a companion `nearest_edge` field naming which boundary you are closest to: `risk`, `coherence`, or `void` from the margin computation, or `oscillation` when a CIRS `cirs_block` pause was driven by resonance. On `comfortable` and `settling`, `nearest_edge` is `null`.

`margin` is distance to a **decision threshold**, not a basin position. Two fields ride beside it and qualify what a `comfortable` reading actually covers:

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `margin_scope` | `all_edges`, `measured_edges_only` | Whether every edge was judged, or only some of them (emitted on `comfortable` and `tight`; absent on `settling`, `warning`, `critical`) |
| `unmeasurable_edges` | list of edge names | The edges that had no band to judge against, so they were not assessed at all |

An edge is unmeasurable when it has no threshold band for this agent. Coherence is the usual case, and the gate is provenance, not history: the coherence edge is judged only when `coherence_role` is `behavioral_update_consistency` (`GovernanceConfig.COHERENCE_INTERPRETABLE_ROLE`), the history window carries that same role, and at least 10 samples exist. With the deployed `legacy_tanh_v` / `ode_control_feedback` producer the edge stays unmeasurable no matter how much history accumulates, so `comfortable` normally arrives as `margin_scope: measured_edges_only` with `unmeasurable_edges: ["coherence"]`. `comfortable` with `margin_scope: measured_edges_only` means "clear of the edges we could judge", not "nothing is near": read `unmeasurable_edges` for what was never assessed. Prefer the live values over assuming a fixed enum across runtime versions — `check_working_state()` is the source of truth.

Do not transfer this check-in margin into recovery eligibility. Recovery emits a
separate `recovery.margin.v2` view whose authoritative inputs are risk and
`void_active`; legacy coherence is explicitly listed as excluded diagnostic
context. Its enum is its own (`unknown` / `critical` / `tight` / `comfortable`,
with `nearest_edge` ∈ `void_active` / `risk_score` / `no_risk_authority`).

The plain-English `mirror` array in your check-in response already summarizes anything actionable (including a tight/warning/critical margin) — read that first. In `mirror` mode `margin`/`nearest_edge` are surfaced **only** when actionable; a `comfortable`/`settling` margin is steady-state and stays out of the response (the mirror's "No actionable signals — steady state" line covers it).

## Coherence

`coherence` is an overloaded compatibility field, not one universal instrument.
Interpret it only with the accompanying `coherence_source` and `coherence_role`:

| Source | Role | Valid interpretation |
|--------|------|----------------------|
| `legacy_tanh_v` | `ode_control_feedback` | Directional ODE controller activation. It is monotone in signed V, equals 0.5 at balance, and is **not** a symmetric health/balance score. |
| `manifold` | `eis_structural_measurement` | Grounded distance over E/I/S. It has a different distribution; legacy thresholds do not transfer. |
| `behavioral_assessment` | `behavioral_update_consistency` | HCK/update consistency carried in the behavioral assessment, distinct from the canonical compatibility scalar. |
| `grounded` | `eis_structural_measurement` | Same role as `manifold`; a grounded structural reading. |

- Full range is [0, 1], but range alone does not establish semantics.
- Untagged historical rows are `unknown_legacy` unless their producer can be reconstructed deterministically.
- Existing critical thresholds are compatibility gates, not validated quality grades. Do not recalibrate them merely to force alarm crossings.
- The check-in actuator still contains those backstops. Outside that migration
  boundary, recovery eligibility/margin, stuck recovery, dialectic triage,
  anomaly entropy, peer ranking, and automatic ground-truth fallback no longer
  treat legacy `C(V)` as authority.
- New dialectic conditions should not target legacy coherence. Stored
  unprovenanced `coherence_target` conditions retire without escalating policy.
- Prefer the behavioral assessment and policy provenance for live interpretation; use legacy ODE values as telemetry/research context.

## Calibration

The system tracks whether your stated confidence matches evidence. Over time this builds a calibration curve.

- Grounding comes from objective signals: test pass/fail, command exit codes, lint results, file operations. These feed calibration automatically via `auto_ground_truth.py` and the `outcome_event` hook. Human validation is not required for deterministic evidence.
- Overconfidence is tracked and can lower Integrity / raise uncertainty through the check-in pipeline
- When an agent omits confidence, the deployed compatibility estimator still gives legacy `C(V_ODE)` 55% of its base weight. Responses expose this as `confidence_reliability.coherence_dependency=ode_control_feedback`; it is known causal debt, not independent confidence evidence. Do not reweight it without prospective outcome calibration because confidence history can feed later entropy penalties.
- That derived estimate stays internal: omitted confidence does not mint an agent tactical prediction or become an agent-reported calibration observation. Earlier explicit predictions remain available for their eventual outcomes. Simulation restores prediction bookkeeping and does not write trajectory calibration observations.

## Diagnostics

When the numbers look surprising, do not guess first. Use:

- `identity()` to verify who the runtime thinks you are
- `health_check()` to verify the server and knowledge graph are healthy
- `check_working_state()` for the current interpreted state, risk provenance,
  and compatibility thresholds

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not treat coherence as a score to optimize** — interpret its producer and role
- **Do not ignore guide verdicts** — they are early warnings before pause/reject
- **Do not create duplicate discoveries** — always search the knowledge graph first
- **Do not check in after every trivial action** — it is noise, not signal
- **Do not leave high-severity findings as open forever** — resolve or archive them
