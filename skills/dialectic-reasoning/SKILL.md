# Dialectic Reasoning

## When Dialectics Happen

A dialectic session is useful when:

- You receive a **pause** or **reject** verdict and want to contest it
- You call `request_review()` for peer or model-assisted verification
- You find something that contradicts the knowledge graph
- A high-stakes decision needs structured verification before proceeding

Dialectics are not punishment. They are a structured way to resolve disagreements using evidence and negotiation. In current UNITARES language, think of them as structured review more than "recovery court."

## Phase 1: Thesis

The paused agent submits their position (the protocol rejects a thesis from
anyone else):

```
dialectic(
  action: "thesis",
  session_id: "<session-id>",
  reasoning: "Why I should resume / why my position is correct",
  root_cause: "What went wrong or what triggered this",
  proposed_conditions: ["Concrete, measurable condition 1", "Condition 2"]
)
```

### One-call review (the friendly default)

You do not have to learn the request→thesis protocol first. The friendly
`request_review` tool reuses `issue_description` as the thesis when no separate
thesis fields are supplied, so a complete review brief is actionable as-is:

```
request_review(
  issue_description: "What you want verified, your position, and the evidence"
)
```

Pass `reasoning` (and optionally `root_cause` / `proposed_conditions`) when the
position should be distinct from the subject. Pass `use_brief_as_thesis=false`
for a neutral request that deliberately waits for a later thesis. The raw
`dialectic(action="request")` path preserves that two-call default unless you
pass thesis fields or `use_brief_as_thesis=true`.

For a session already waiting in the thesis phase, reuse what the server saved
instead of copying it back:

```
dialectic(
  action: "thesis",
  session_id: "<session-id>",
  use_brief_as_thesis: true
)
```

`root_cause` is always required. Recovery sessions additionally require at
least one concrete `proposed_condition`; manual review sessions may let the
reviewer propose conditions if needed.

### Writing a Good Thesis

- **Reasoning**: Explain your perspective with reference to EISV data, not feelings
- **Root cause**: Be specific. "High entropy from complex refactoring task" is better than "I got paused for no reason"
- **Proposed conditions**: Must be concrete and measurable. Tie them to live metrics or observable behavior, not vague intent.

## Phase 2: Antithesis

A reviewing agent examines the thesis and raises concerns:

```
dialectic(
  action: "antithesis",
  session_id: "<session-id>",
  reasoning: "Counter-arguments to the thesis",
  concerns: ["Specific risk 1", "Specific risk 2"],
  observed_metrics: { E: 0.45, I: 0.38, S: 0.62, V: 0.18 }
)
```

### Writing a Good Antithesis

- **Reasoning**: Address the thesis directly. What does the data actually show?
- **Concerns**: Be specific about risks. "I exceeds E by 0.3, indicating integrity debt" is useful.
- **Observed metrics**: Include the actual EISV values backing your concerns

### Stamp where the verdict came from

If the review was produced **outside the server** — a Codex or other-model
consult, a subagent council, any reviewer that is not this MCP — file it with
`reviewer_provenance` so it becomes a governed record rather than an untracked
opinion:

```
dialectic(
  action: "antithesis",
  session_id: "<session-id>",
  reasoning: "<the counter-perspective or observations; required>",
  concerns: ["<one per finding>"],
  observed_metrics: {},
  reviewer_provenance: {
    reviewer_kind: "external_consult",   # see the caution below
    backend: "codex-cli",
    model_used: "<model>",
    consult_source: "<what invoked it>"
  }
)
```

⛔**A misspelled `reviewer_kind` silently becomes `agent_submitted`** — the
server falls back rather than erroring (`handlers.py`,
`kind if kind in _REVIEWER_KINDS else "agent_submitted"`). So a typo does not
fail loudly; it files your outside consult as if you had reviewed it yourself,
which is the one misattribution this field exists to prevent. The agent-suppliable
kinds are exactly `agent_submitted`, `external_consult`, and `orchestrated`
(`in_process_synthetic` is the server's own stamp — do not send it).

Unrecognised keys are dropped (the response lists them), and string values are
truncated at 200 characters. Useful ones beyond the example: `model_requested`,
`models_used`, `tokens_used`, `cost_usd`, `latency_ms`, `finish_reason`,
`fallback_from`, `warnings`, `consulted_at`.

**Why this matters, measured 2026-08-28.** The unitares README records "Benefit
from review and coordination — **Untested**", and names `reviewer_provenance` as
how outside review becomes countable. Across all 669 recorded dialectic
messages, 3 carry `agent_submitted` and **0 carry `external_consult`** — the
path has never been used. Review sessions themselves are routine (136), so this
is not a missing mechanism: it is an optional field nobody fills in. Every
unfiled outside review leaves the record unable to move, however much review
actually happens.

- **Stamp it, don't infer it.** The field is descriptive, not identity proof.
  Record the backend and model that actually ran.
- **Mark failures as failures.** Set `degraded: true` when the consult errored,
  timed out, or returned no verdict. A failed pass filed as a clean one is worse
  than no row at all.
- **Never backfill.** File only a review this session actually performed;
  filing past passes after the fact fabricates governed history.

If identity or session continuity looks suspect, verify with `identity()` before
assuming the thesis belongs to the agent you think it does. An independent
reviewer also receives server-captured pause evidence separately from the paused
agent's narrative. Treat its measurement, policy, and enforcement provenance as
context; legacy `C(V)` is diagnostic controller feedback, not independent
evidence that the thesis is right or wrong.

## Phase 3: Synthesis

Both sides negotiate toward resolution:

```
dialectic(
  action: "synthesis",
  session_id: "<session-id>",
  reasoning: "How we reconcile the thesis and antithesis",
  agrees: true/false,
  proposed_conditions: ["Negotiated condition 1", "Condition 2"]
)
```

For an independent review, the reviewer owes the first synthesis verdict before
the paused agent can answer it. Convergence happens only when the required sides
agree on conditions. A reviewer rejection remains in force: the paused agent
cannot clear it by repeatedly submitting `agrees=true`. The reviewer must revise
after new evidence, or an authorized facilitator must reassign the reviewer.

## Whose Move Is It?

A session waiting on *you* looks identical to a stalled session if you only read
the phase field — on 2026-07-28 a live session awaiting the caller's own
synthesis was read as "stalled" by two experienced operators. So status
responses answer it directly from your seat:

- **`whose_move`** — plain language, for example `"YOURS — your thesis is
  owed; the saved brief can be reused"`, `"the reviewer's — their antithesis is
  owed"`, `"a reviewer's — the slot is OPEN, you may claim it"`, `"YOURS —
  respond once to the reviewer's standing rejection"`, or `"nobody — session is
  terminal"`.
- **`next_call`** — a ready-to-use call template, present only when the move is
  actually yours. If `next_call` is null, you are waiting on someone else.

Read `whose_move` before concluding a session is hung. Use
`dialectic(action="get", session_id="...", check_timeout=true)` when you need the
latest timeout/facilitation state; note that `check_timeout` is a write (it can
auto-reassign or flip the phase) and is silently ignored for an unbound caller. An open reviewer slot in the antithesis phase
is an invitation, not a stall — an eligible agent other than the paused agent
may claim it.

## Facilitation and Reviewer Recovery

If no eligible reviewer remains, the session may report
`awaiting_facilitation`. This is a paused request for human help, not a reviewer
verdict. A timeout sweep can eventually mark it failed, but that sweep outcome
does not mean either side won.

Reviewer reassignment is privileged:

```
dialectic(
  action: "reassign",
  session_id: "<session-id>",
  new_reviewer_id: "<agent-id>",
  reason: "Reviewer unavailable; continue the review"
)
```

Only an authenticated operator or the currently assigned independent reviewer
handing off their own slot may do this. A merely bound agent identity is not
operator authority. Reassignment can revive an `awaiting_facilitation` session,
including one a timeout sweep already marked failed for lack of facilitation.

## Resolution Outcomes

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **resume** | Converged; the agent continues with the agreed conditions |
| **block** | The agreed resolution violated a hard safety limit; the session is marked `failed` |
| **facilitation_required** / `awaiting_facilitation` | Standing reviewer rejection, self-review, or no eligible reviewer; an operator or replacement reviewer must act |

`escalate` and `cooldown` exist in the `ResolutionAction` enum but no live path
produces them; they survive only as recommendation labels in the model-assisted
tool.

## How to Participate Well

- **Be honest about metrics.** The EISV data is right there. Denying it undermines your credibility.
- **Propose measurable conditions.** "Entropy below X within Y check-ins" is verifiable. "I will be more careful" is not.
- **Do not be defensive.** A pause verdict is data, not judgment. Analyze why it happened.
- **Acknowledge valid concerns.** If the antithesis raises a real issue, say so. Partial agreement strengthens your position.
- **Look at attributed evidence, not feelings.** Call `check_working_state()`
  (`get_governance_metrics()` canonically) for the current values and inspect
  `risk_score_source` and `verdict_source` / `verdict_resolution_source`; the
  `policy_evaluation` and `enforcement` blocks come back on your last
  `sync_state()` check-in, not on the metrics call. EISV is proprioceptive
  state estimation, not outcome truth; the ODE lens and legacy `C(V)` do not
  independently validate a claim.

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring the metrics**: Arguing against a pause while your entropy is near 1.0 and energy is at 0.3. The numbers matter.
- **Proposing impossible conditions**: promising a metric target without checking the live state first.
- **Being defensive instead of analytical**: "The system is wrong" vs. "My entropy spiked because of X, and here is how I address it."
- **Treating dialectic as adversarial**: It is collaborative problem-solving with structure, not a trial. Both sides benefit from honest resolution.
- **Rushing synthesis**: Agreeing to conditions you cannot meet just to get unpaused guarantees a future pause.
