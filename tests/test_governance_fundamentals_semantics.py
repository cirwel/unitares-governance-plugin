    # Deliberately a frozen literal, not a derived value: this assertion is a
    # tripwire. Any edit to the skill fails here until someone re-reads the
    # coherence contract below and re-stamps on purpose. Bumped 2026-08-21 for
    # the v2.19.0 margin-semantics correction, which did not touch coherence.
    #
    # Bumped 2026-09-08 by the canonical skills sync (unitares#2106 era mirror
    # refresh). This one DID touch coherence, so it was re-read rather than
    # re-stamped: the unmeasurable-edge paragraph now states that the coherence
    # edge is gated on PROVENANCE rather than on history -- it is judged only
    # when `coherence_role` is `behavioral_update_consistency`
    # (GovernanceConfig.COHERENCE_INTERPRETABLE_ROLE) with a matching history
    # window and >=10 samples, so under the deployed `legacy_tanh_v` /
    # `ode_control_feedback` producer it stays unmeasurable however much
    # history accumulates. A `grounded` -> `eis_structural_measurement` row
    # joins the producer table, and `nearest_edge` gains `oscillation` for a
    # CIRS `cirs_block` pause. Every substantive assertion in this file passed
    # unchanged against the new text, including the four producer roles below
    # and the three sibling tests that forbid the health/balance framing and
    # require the hidden E/I and confidence dependencies to stay disclosed --
    # the additions widen the disclosure, they do not soften it.
