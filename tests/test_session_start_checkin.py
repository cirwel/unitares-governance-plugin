"""Contract tests for the SessionStart hook.

After the identity-honesty Part C refactor (2026-04-17) and the identity-
hijack hardening of 2026-04-20, the hook does NOT create an identity on
the agent's behalf AND does NOT surface other instances' UUIDs as a
resume menu. It only:

  1. Confirms governance is reachable.
  2. Suggests start_session(force_new=true) with onboard(...) as canonical fallback.
  3. If THIS workspace has slot-scoped continuity state, surfaces a lineage
     candidate for parent_agent_id, not a resume credential.
  4. Never enumerates ~/.unitares/session-*.json — those are other instances'
     identities, and surfacing them as an unfiltered "Recent session UUIDs"
     menu invited cross-instance hijack (KG bug 2026-04-20T00:09:51).

These tests lock in the post-2026-04-20 contract:
  - Hook emits ZERO HTTP tool calls on SessionStart.
  - Online context describes the provisional-free state.
  - Online context surfaces ONLY the workspace-local continuity cache, if any.
  - Online context never lists ~/.unitares/session-*.json contents.
  - Offline context reports OFFLINE and does not reference a fake identity.
