"""Golden snapshots of the RENDERED SessionStart preamble.

Source review keeps missing this surface. The hook is ~750 lines of bash
that assembles one of several agent-facing variants; what matters is the
text that actually ships, and which variant ships when. Two real misses
this file exists to prevent:

1. A judgment that a paragraph was redundant with the Fundamentals skill --
   when that skill contains ZERO identity terms, and the paragraph was the
   sole carrier of `parent_agent_id`, `lineage`, and `resume` in the
   rendered full variant. Deleting it would have dropped all three to zero
   with no test failing.
2. A plan to gate content by model capability -- when line 25 hard-gates
   the whole hook to claude|codex, so the weak-model consumer it was aimed
   at never sees this text at all.

Neither is visible while reading the source top-to-bottom. Both are
obvious in the rendered output.

Two layers here, deliberately:

- **Byte goldens** catch "the text changed" and put the diff in review.
- **Term assertions** catch "the CONCEPT left", which survives rewording.
  A golden alone would happily accept a rewrite that drops
  `parent_agent_id` entirely, as long as you regenerated it.

Regenerate after an intentional change:
