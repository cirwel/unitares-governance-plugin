"""Slot-aware session-cache lookup for governance plugin hooks.

The plugin writes the session cache to a slotted file so concurrent
Claude Code sessions don't collide on one ``.unitares/session.json``.
Hooks fired from Claude Code receive the slot identifier on stdin
(the ``session_id`` field of the hook payload); this helper mirrors
the slot-hashing logic from ``onboard_helper.py`` so every hook
reads the same file the onboard helper wrote.

Public API:
    resolve_session_file(workspace, slot) -> Path | None
    load_session_for_hook(workspace, stdin_payload) -> dict

``load_session_for_hook`` is the one-liner most hooks want: pass the
current working directory plus whatever came in on stdin, get back
a dict with ``uuid``, ``client_session_id``, ``continuity_token``,
``slot`` (and whatever else the cache wrote). Returns an empty dict
if nothing matches.

    With a slot, the slot-scoped cache is the only eligible target. The

    to ``$HOME/.unitares/session-<slot>.json`` (PWD-mismatch fallback, see
    below). Without a slot, a workspace-local legacy path is eligible.
    Returns None if no matching file exists.

    Identity-honesty note (2026-04-18): the prior unslotted
    ``$HOME/.unitares/session.json`` last-resort fallback was removed because
    it was an axiom-violating *shared* cache — any same-UID Claude Code /
    Codex / CLI session whose own slotted or workspace-unslotted cache was
    empty would silently adopt whatever identity the most recent writer left
    there, siphoning one UUID across parallel agents (invariant #3:
    per-instance isolation).

    PWD-mismatch fallback (2026-05-10): a *slotted* HOME read is structurally
    distinct from the deleted unslotted fallback. The slot key is the Claude
    Code ``session_id`` — globally unique per Claude session. Parallel agents
    have different session_ids, so they read different filenames at HOME and
    cannot collapse onto each other's cache. This fallback addresses the
    specific failure mode where ``post-identity`` runs with PWD=X (writing
    ``X/.unitares/session-<slot>.json``) and later ``post-edit`` runs with
    PWD=Y (looking in ``Y/.unitares/...``, miss) — empirically the dominant
    cause of dark sessions per ~/.unitares/hook-skips.log evidence. The HOME
    file becomes findable regardless of PWD because the slot anchors it.

    Callers that previously depended on the *unslotted* HOME fallback still
    must pass ``workspace=Path.home()`` explicitly; silent collapse onto the
    shared ``session.json`` is still impossible.
