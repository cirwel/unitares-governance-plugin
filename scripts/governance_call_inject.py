"""PreToolUse injector — ensure governance MCP calls carry client_session_id.

Claude Code's streamable HTTP transport is stateless (no Mcp-Session-Id), so
any governance call that omits identity arguments resolves server-side via
the `recent_onboard:<ip:ua>` Redis pin — a heuristic that any parallel
non-subagent onboard on the same host can legitimately displace (the
2026-06-10 driver-capture incident class; server PR #604 closed the subagent
displacement vector, this hook removes the driver's dependence on the pin
entirely). Calls carrying client_session_id resolve at step 2 with
identity_assurance tier=strong and are immune to the pin.

This hook also normalizes the `tags` list on knowledge-graph calls (casing,
separators, de-dup) before they reach the server, so the shared graph does
not fragment on `Postgres`/`postgres`/`PostgreSQL`. That pass is
formatting-only, runs independently of (and never disables) identity
injection, and lives in scripts/tag_normalize.py — see docs/ontology-need.md.
Codex does not rewrite multi-action knowledge calls because applying any input
rewrite there would also pre-approve the call.

Contract:
- Only fires for MCP tools whose case-normalized server segment exactly matches
  a configured UNITARES alias. Lookalike names receive no rewrite or implicit
  Codex approval.
- Only fires for an explicit suffix allowlist of attribution-relevant tools
  verified to accept client_session_id (schemas inherit AgentIdentityMixin
  server-side). Unknown/new tools get NO injection — they degrade to today's
  pin behavior rather than risking an extra-field validation error.
- For identity minting tools, only fires for orchestrated anchored bare
  onboard/start_session calls: UNITARES_CLIENT_SESSION_ID and a truthy
  UNITARES_ORCHESTRATED marker must both be present, and force_new must be
  absent. Explicit force_new and explicit proof fields still win. Never
  injects into bind_session/identity.
- Skips when the call already carries any identity proof field
  (client_session_id, continuity_token, agent_uuid, agent_id) — explicit
  caller intent always wins.
- Reads ONLY the slot-scoped session cache (slot = Claude session_id via
  _session_lookup; no workspace-flat fallback). With the post-identity
  subagent guard, the slot cache holds the driver's identity.
- Claude emits hookSpecificOutput.updatedInput without a permission decision,
  so its normal permission flow is unchanged. Codex requires
  permissionDecision="allow" whenever updatedInput is returned. Codex rewrites
  only anchored lifecycle, check-in, and read-only diagnostic calls; admin-
  capable tools keep their normal permission flow and require explicit proof.
- Fails open: any error or missing cache → no output, tool runs untouched.

Known residual (KNOWINGLY ACCEPTED, council-reviewed 2026-06-12): both this
guard and server #604 key on spawn_reason=="subagent" being DECLARED. A
non-declaring subagent is invisible to both: its onboard still overwrites
the slot cache (post-identity can't see it), and this injector would then
propagate that poisoned identity into the driver's later argless calls at
tier=strong — overriding the otherwise-protective server pin. For DECLARED
subagents the no-widening claim holds: their argless calls already resolve
to the driver via the standing SET-NX pin, so injection makes the same
attribution explicit and lintable. The deferred close-path for the
non-declaring residual is subagent discrimination from hook context
(e.g. transcript_path), rejected for now because misclassifying a
succession onboard would dark-session the driver — the inverse failure.

Epistemic note: rows resolved through an injected client_session_id read
server-side as identity_assurance tier=strong / explicit_client_session_id.
That tier here reflects HARNESS-MAINTAINED process continuity, not an
agent-asserted proof — the agent never typed the token.
