# Check-In Triggers

The Claude adapter emits canonical `process_agent_update` calls at three trigger points.
`session-start` is deliberately read-only: it checks server reachability,
fetches the governance fundamentals excerpt, and prompts the agent to call
`start_session(force_new=true)` / `onboard(force_new=true)` itself only when no
identity is cached for this fresh process. If the agent does not do that before
the turn ends, `post-stop` lazily onboards a slot-scoped identity before
emitting `turn_stop`; if that fails, it records an identity-free floor
observation instead. Once a process is bound, later turns continue via
`client_session_id` and `sync_state()` rather than fresh onboarding.

| Trigger | Hook script | Frequency | `metadata.event` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude turn ends | `post-stop` | per Claude turn | `turn_stop` |
| Edit threshold crossed | `post-edit` | every N edits or T seconds | `auto_edit` |
| Session closes | `session-end` | once per session | `session_end` |

All emissions share one shared helper (`scripts/checkin.py`) that:
- Applies secret-pattern redaction to `response_text` before POST
- Truncates `response_text` to 512 chars
- Logs one status line per attempt to `~/.unitares/checkins.log`
- Returns fire-and-forget: never raises, never blocks a Claude turn on failure

## Kill switch

`UNITARES_CHECKINS=off` in the environment suppresses every plugin-emitted
check-in. Disable a single trigger by removing its entry from
`hooks/hooks.json`.

## Diagnosing check-in behavior

```bash
tail -f ~/.unitares/checkins.log
```

Expected line format:
```
2026-04-17T02:45:12Z | slot=abc12345 | event=turn_stop | uuid=86ae619f | status=sent | latency_ms=42
```

Statuses: `sent` (accepted by governance), `fail` (POST failed — see `err=...`), `skip_kill_switch` (suppressed by `UNITARES_CHECKINS=off`), `error` (client-side exception; caller passed garbage values).

## Protective audit

Run the local identity-contract audit when check-ins look wrong, before shipping
adapter changes, or from a lightweight monitor:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_identity_contract.py --workspace "$PWD" --log-tail 200
```

The audit checks slot-scoped session caches and the hook diagnostic log without
contacting the governance server. Hard failures include non-empty
`continuity_token` at rest, unreadable session JSON, and session caches with no
`uuid` or `client_session_id`. Warnings include flat legacy `session.json`, weak
`session_resolution_source` values such as `ip_ua_fingerprint`, and log statuses
like `floor_sent`, `floor_fail`, `fail`, or `error`. Use `--log-tail N` or
`--since 24h` for operational monitoring, `--json` for monitor output, and
`--fail-on-warning` when warnings should break CI.

## Strict thread-anchor canary

Before changing the Discord/dispatch thread identity path or advancing a
`STRICT_IDENTITY_REQUIRED` rollout, run the thread-anchor contract canary:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev/strict_thread_anchor_contract.py --json
```

That local mode checks the plugin envelope only: a thread
`UNITARES_CLIENT_SESSION_ID` is forwarded only when the orchestrated marker is
present, and a bare anchor falls back to fresh minting. To probe a live strict
governance server, add `--live`:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev/strict_thread_anchor_contract.py \
  --live \
  --server-url "http://127.0.0.1:8767" \
  --json
```

Live mode writes a unique canary identity. It asserts the full boundary: a bare
`agent:/thread-*` resume miss returns `lineage_declaration_required`, while
`orchestrated=true` first-binds and a second turn resumes the same UUID.

## Known limitation

The edit-threshold auto-checkin previously supported `UNITARES_HTTP_API_TOKEN`
for Bearer-token auth against remote governance. The refactored helper uses
stdlib urllib and does not pass this header. Local-only deployments (the
supported default) are unaffected.

## Upgrading from plugin 0.2.0

Claude Code caches installed plugins at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/`. A cache at version `0.2.0` predates the check-in trigger hooks shipped in `0.3.0`. To force a refresh:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/unitares-governance-plugin/unitares-governance/0.2.0/
```

The cache will repopulate on the next Claude Code launch. Verify the refresh landed by checking `hooks/` contains `post-stop` and `session-end` under the new version path.
